# Evangelion-404th-Impact
Simple Evangelion themed "404 Not Found" page, you can try it [**here**](https://torusaynim.github.io/Evangelion-404th-Impact/)

## Features

 - Design inspired by title cards from original ***Neon Genesis Evangelion*** series
 - Clickable last line to return you back to homepage
 - Design is adapted for different types of devices with different screen size

## How to set it up

1. Download the code and rename the page to something different, **404.html** for example
2. Put this page wherever you like in your server directory
3. Create **.htaccess** in the root directory of your server (if you don't have it) and then edit it by adding the following line `ErrorDocument 404 /404.html` where everything after `/` is the full path to your custom 404 page inside server directory
4. Save everything and try to open a page that doesn't exist to test it
5. You're done, enjoy your custom 404 page!
