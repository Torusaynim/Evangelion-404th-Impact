# Evangelion-404th-Impact
Simple Evangelion themed 404 page I came up with on random evening. You can try it [**here**](https://torusaynim.github.io/Evangelion-404th-Impact/)

<p align="center"><img src="reference.png"></p>

Page should be adapted for most devices. If it doesn't please submit new issue mentioning used device and browser, or you can fix it yourselves and create new PR.
My only request is to keep the page a single file please

## Special thanks
