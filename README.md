# Evangelion-404th-Impact
Simple Evangelion themed "404 Not Found" page, you can try it [**here**](https://torusaynim.github.io/Evangelion-404th-Impact/)

## Features

 - Design inspired by title cards from original ***Neon Genesis Evangelion*** series
 - Clickable last line to return you back to homepage
 - Design is adapted for different types of devices with different screen size

## How to set it up

1. Download the code and rename the page to something different, **404.html** for example
2. Put this page wherever you like in your server directory
3. Create **.htaccess** in the root directory of your server and edit it by adding the following line `ErrorDocument 404 /404.html` where everything after `/` is the full path to your custom 404 page inside server directory
4. Save everything and try to open page that don't exist to test it
5. You're done, enjoy your custom 404 page!
